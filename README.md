# stock-trend-predictions
Project for subject VNP (FINKI)

Here you can find my work in 3 files _analyst_recommendations_predictions.ipynb, eps_revenue_predictions.ipynb_ and _insider_data_prediction.ipynb_.

- _analyst_recommendations_predictions.ipynb_ contains predictions of stock trends using analyst recommendations like Buy, Hold, StrongBuy, StrongSell, Hold signals.
- eps_revenue_predictions.ipynb_ contains predictions of stock trends using information like estimated eps, revenue and similar data combined with the real counterparts.
- _insider_data_prediction.ipynb_ contains predictions of stock trends using insider transactions.

This project will continue by improving on these, and combining them all together into a single model.
